# ðŸ§  Smart ATS â€” Resume & JD Matcher

Smart ATS is a **Streamlit-based application** that evaluates how well a resume matches a given Job Description (JD).  
It uses a **hybrid approach** that combines keyword extraction (ATS-style) with **semantic similarity** powered by embeddings â€” all without requiring any paid API keys.

## Features
1. **ATS-style Keyword Extraction**  
   - Uses TF-IDF to extract top n-grams from the JD.  
   - Expands bigrams into unigrams for broader coverage.

2. **Hybrid Matching (Exact + Semantic)**  
   - First checks for exact matches of JD terms in the resume.  
   - Then applies sentence-transformer embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to find semantically similar matches.  

3. **Sentence-Level Similarity**  
   - Compares every JD sentence against resume sentences to calculate semantic alignment.

4. **Scoring System**  
   - Final score (0â€“100) = **70% semantic similarity + 30% keyword coverage**.  

5. **Detailed Report**  
   - Outputs a downloadable `match_report.json` containing scores, matched and missing skills, and debug info.  

6. **Resume Bullet Suggestions**  
   - Generates contextual, professional bullet points to strengthen your resume based on missing skills.
